         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>One <hi>Pithius,</hi> a crafty Sicilian, finding an honeſt Romane Gentleman, called <hi>Canius,</hi> Deſirous of a pleaſant Garden in the Iland, he inuited him to his; and conducted diuers poore Fiſhermen to attend that day his Bankes, with Boates and Nets; and to bring in plenty of fiſh, and to lay them at his feete. The Gueſt asking what that meant, was anſwered by the Hux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, That it was the Royalty of that place, there was more fiſh thereabouts, then in any other ſtreame of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſe. And as oft as he repaired thither, that ſeruice was due, and done vnto him. The poore Gentleman was taken with the Nets, and preſently dealeth with the owner for the Garden, who ſuffering himſelfe to be much improtuned, at the length was intreated to ſell it full deerely: The day following, the buyer, diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

The plaine folk anſwered, <hi>None they knew of;</hi> &amp; further wondred at the former reſort, for they neuer ſaw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Boates or Fiſhermen there. In a word, hee was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened. But it is not ſo in this fiſhing Proiect, to the which you are now inuited frankely and plainely: <hi>Nullae hic piſcatorum ferae;</hi> we may alwaies fiſh here without feare of any <hi>Sicilian</hi> purchaſe, or ſcarcity of the Romane <hi>Macrobius</hi> his Table, where there was <hi>Piſcis,</hi> but <hi>paucoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hominum.</hi> Here is fiſh, the King of fiſh, the meate and Marchandize of both remote and neighbour Nations. To perſwade hereto, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour hath dealt by way of compariſon, not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to derogate from other <hi>Trades,</hi> but to aduance this Myſterie, and indeed, to ſhew that they may all receiue true nouriſhment from this nurſery. Let therefore no man take that with the left hand which is offered with the right. And though, by the opinion of ſome of vnderſtanding in thoſe faculties, there is a reaſonable ſuruey giuen of our <hi>Sea-trades, State,</hi> and <hi>Breeding;</hi> and out of others iudgements, there is euen <hi>Candor animi</hi> in all particulars, without either ſuſpicion of any perſonall taxation offered, or any States blot ſuſ-ſpected: Yet I deſire alſo to profeſſe the Authours true and faire meaning herein, and to make good the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights that may bee committed in the particular tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe, with that of the Poet, <hi>Vbi plurima nitent, Non

Which impoſition, ſay our men, made our Countrey men forbeare their carrying any more Coales abroad, becauſe the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> would not giue aboue their old rate: and which was worſe, thereby they ſold away their ſhippes, ſome to <hi>France,</hi> ſome to <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſome to other Countries. Whereby ſure their faults are more apparant then their ill fortune, in that though their gaine was leſſe at the inſtant, by the impoſition then former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; yet to leaue the Trade, argued neither good ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, nor great vnderſtanding, nor any eſpeciall good minde to their Countrey. For whence I pray you came ſuch a neceſſity to leaue the Trade and to giue ouer ſhipping, as if they could not liue thereby; when preſently forraigne Nations fell to the Trade themſelues, as is formerly ſet downe, and fetch away our coales on the ſame tearmes which wee do refuſe? And by report, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the fiue ſhillings impoſed, the <hi>French</hi> do ſell in <hi>France</hi> one Chauldron of coales

The ſtranger keeping his coine at home, bringeth hither bare and baſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, their ſhipping &amp; Mariners are employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and increaſed; and notwithſtanding the <hi>Argus</hi> eyes of the Searcher, carry gold away with them, alwaies bringing more in ſtocke with them, then they carry away in commodities.</p>
               <p>For to make a motion to haue this fiue ſhillings excuſed in our owne Nation, is rather profitable then neceſſary, in regard wee ſee the ſtranger thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth notwithſtanding it, and it being done out of his Maieſties royal prerogatiue, <hi>&amp; ex cauſa lucrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua,</hi> as is apparant by what the ſtranger gaineth; and the like is willingly imbraced here in other tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations, as Beere, &amp;c. were, me thinkes, vndu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull likewiſe.

When they came thither, they found in ſtead of faire white Swans, greedy Rauens, and deuouring Crowes; and heard, in ſtead of melodious harmony, vntune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and loathſome croaking. In indignation that they were ſo receiued and deceiued, in ſtead of applauding, they hiſſed; and of ſtaying, fled away. You are now braue <hi>Eaſt Indies, Meander</hi> floud, your Trade is the ſinging of Swannes, which ſo many iourney ſo farre to enioy. God forbid you ſhould be found ſo diſcoloured, and we ſo ill ſatisfied. And howſoeuer that I may be ſure to auoide any detraction, whereby my nature might haue any imputation, or by calling vp more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits into the circle then I can put downe againe, I might incurre ſome danger, and be taxed likewiſe of indiſcretion, for that we onely hitherto haue complained of the want of Shipping; we deſire now but herein to ſuruey the ſtore, and ſee how
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:26892:11"/>you helpe the increaſe. You haue built more Ships in your time, and greater farre then any other Merchants Ships; beſides what you haue bought out of other Trades, and all thoſe wholly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you; there hath beene entertained by you ſince you firſt aduentured, one and twentie Ships, beſides the now intended voiage of one new Ship of ſeuen hundred Tunne; and happily ſome two more of increaſe. The leaſt of all your Shipping is of foure ſcore Tunne: all the reſt are goodly Shippes, of ſuch burthen as neuer were formerly vſed in Merchandize; the leaſt and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of theſe laſt is of ſome hundred and twentie Tunne, and ſo go vpward euen to eleuen hundred Tunne. You haue ſet forth ſome thirteen voyages, in which time you haue built of theſe, eight new Shippes, and almoſt as good as built the moſt of the reſidue, as the <hi>Dragon,</hi> the <hi>Hector, &amp;c.</hi> ſo that at the firſt appearance you haue added both ſtrength and glory to the King dome by this your acceſſion to the Nauy. But where I pray you are all theſe Ships? foure of theſe are caſt away, of the which one was of three hundred Tunne, another of foure hundred, the third of three hundred, and the fourth of eleuen hundred; two more are docked vp there as Pinaces to Trade vp and down: the reſt are either employed in the Trade in the <hi>Indies,</hi> or at home out of reparations; which if true, if the Kingdome ſhould haue need of them on any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, it ſhall ſurely want their ſeruice; and ſo then there is not onely no ſupply to the Nauy this way, but hurt euen to the whole kingdome, the woods
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:26892:12"/>being cut downe, and the Shippes either loſt, or not ſeruiceable. Surely ſtories can ſhew vs, which we may reade in the courſes of Common-weales, how tolerable, nay how laudable it is in all States, to enlarge Commerce. Merchants whom wee ſhould reſpect, can tell vs of the caſualties which not onely the Ships, but their eſtates are ſubiect to by aduentures. Mariners whom we muſt pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, can teach vs of the ordinary dangers not onely that Shippes and goods, but their liues are ſubiect to by ſea. I muſt not then exprobrate that to them which is to be imputed to the Sea; nor are they to be blamed out of reaſon for that which deſerueth, in humanity, commiſeration; nor is <hi>England</hi> bounded by our Horizon, to go no further then we ſee.

Our woods extraordinarily cut downe, in regard of the greatneſſe of the Shipping, which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:26892:12"/>doth as it were deuoure our timber. I am able out of ſufficient teſtimony to affirme, that ſince the <hi>Indian</hi> Trade, and meerely through their building of their ſhips of ſo great burthen, and their repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring (the building notwithſtanding beganne but fiue yeares ſince) that timber is raiſed in the Land fiue ſhillings, and more, in the loade, nay, almoſt not to be had for money, which the Company (no queſtion) being ſenſible of, very wiſely ſeeke to helpe themſelues in, by building of ſhips in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for their ſeruice: yet it ſeemeth their incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement that was, is but <hi>neceſsitous</hi> in regard by their owne ſaying, beſides the hazard, the charges are little leſſe; and which is worſe, that kinde of timber is but vntoward for that vſe, being ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame heauy, that a ſhip of ſmall burden, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth much water. If in fiue yeares ſpace their buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, together with their repairing of ſhippes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt equall to building, beget ſuch a ſcarcitie, what will a little continuance bring forth? Bring forth I cannot ſay ought, but a priuation will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low euen of all our timber-wood.

In this their Land-ſtratageme, I ſee our ſea-Arts, in that and theſe woods being the fatal inſtrument of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, boughes of Trees kept the <hi>Kentiſh-men</hi> out of ſeruitude, when they held them in their hands, and but for ſhew; their bodies will keepe vs in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty when they containe vs, and are for ſeruice, and by their mouing on the water they will amaze both <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and whomſoeuer, and keepe them, and all others, from comming neere vs:
<note place="margin">34. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.17.13. <hi>Eliz.</hi> 25.</note> Out of which prouident fore-ſight, our moſt worthy Princes formerly raigning, haue made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Lawes in fauour of timber trees:
<note place="margin">Forbidding by Proclamation the building with Timber.</note> and our moſt noble King hath prouided therto with new acceſſions for the preſeruing and increaſing of them; but that a parricide of woods ſhould thus be committed by building of ſhips, it was neuer thought on by any of our royall <hi>Solons,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was no prouiſo for it: Nay, this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience was ſo little ſuſpected, that our ſayd famous Princes haue prouided cleane contrary, with great bounty and indulgence, haning enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:26892:13"/>by reward out of their owne purſes the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of great ſhips; as beſtowing on the builders fiue ſhillings on the Tun for euery Tunne that is builded aboue one hundred Tun in a ſhip, ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary did the Prince thinke his maintenance of ſhipping, the acceſſion thereof conſiſting much in their greatneſſe, to the honour and ſafety of the Kingdome; &amp; ſuch vſe he made account he ſhould haue of them. Whereas now this way he contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, to the ſpoile of his woods, to the loſſe of the ſhips, and to the hurt of the Kingdome. I heard a Ship-wright ſay on the loſſe of the <hi>Trades Increaſe,</hi> that if you ride forty miles from about <hi>London,</hi> you could not finde ſufficient Timber to build ſuch an other. It was a ſhip of eleuen hundred Tunne for beauty, burthen, ſtrength, and ſufficiency, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing all Marchants ſhips whatſoeuer. But alas! ſhee was but ſhewne, out of a cruell deſtiny ſhee was ouertaken with an vntimely death in her youth and ſtrength; being deuoured by thoſe Iron wormes of that Country, that pierced her heart, and brake many a mans withall memorable in her misfortune, onely redounding to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealthes loſſe. For as for the Marchants, though I pitie their aduentures with all my heart, yet in this their part of loſſe was leaſt; for all their goods were on ſhore; and ſhe had brought aboundance out of the <hi>Mecha</hi> Fleete, which ſhe did both tith and toll: And thankes be to God, they are more then ſauers by what is returned from her, and more then that often, by the grace of God, will come from her to the Marchants gaine.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:26892:14"/>
               <p>The like vntimely fall had the other three of great burthen, galla nt ſhips, neuer hauing had the fortune to ſee their natiue ſoile againe, or the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to do their Country any ſeruice, in reſpect of all other ſhips that wander ordinarily to other Countries, therefore I may iuſtly ſay that they die not the ordinary death of ſhips, who commonly haue ſomer eſt, and after long ſeruice die full of yeares, and at home, much of their timber ſeruing againe to the ſame vſe, beſides their Iron-worke, and the reſt otherwiſe ſeruiceable, and not in this bloudy and vnſeaſonable faſhion, rather indeed as coffins full of liue bodies, then otherwiſe as comfortable ſhippes. For the reſt that liue, they come home ſo crazed and broken, ſo maimed and vnmanned, that whereas they went out ſtrong, they returne moſt feeble:
<note place="margin">Our ſhips are faine to take in the natiues of the Indian Countries to ſupply the wants of our dead Sea-men to bring home their ſhippes.</note> and whereas they were carried forth with Chriſtians, they are brought home with Heathen. What the profits are to the Marchants, for ſo great an adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture, I know not. I am ſure amends cannot eaſly be made for ſo great a loſſe, euen in this point which is our ſpecial ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect now, for waſt of woods, &amp; ſpoile of ſhipping.</p>
               <p>And thus we haue ſurueyed all the fountaines whence our ſhipping eſpecially doth flow: which before I ſhut vp, I remember me of a new Spring in <hi>Greeneland,</hi> that batheth ſome ſhips and burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them likewiſe with her owne natural fraight, with the which the Whale is ſo richly loaden withall. This place is but of late frequented ſo eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, and hath employed this laſt yeare ſome foureteene ſhips, and more would do, but that the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:26892:14"/>poore Fiſhermen, who though they knew the place before, yet being belike afraid of the Whale,
<note place="margin">The Moſcouy Merchants haue procured an inhibition for all others from fiſhing there.</note> are now ſwallowed vp in the Whales ſhips.</p>
               <p>I cannot finde any other worthy place of forren anchorage. For the <hi>Bermudas,</hi> we know not yet what they will doe; and for <hi>Virginia</hi> we know not well what to do with it: the preſent profit of thoſe not employing any ſtore of ſhipping: and for this other it is yet but <hi>Embrion:</hi> no queſtion a worthy enterpriſe and of great conſequence, much aboue the Marchants Ieuell &amp; reach. And ſure in regard of the great expences they haue beene at, and the poore returne that is made, they are much to bee regarded &amp; commended for holding out ſo long: I could wiſh, that as many of the Nobility and Gentry of the land haue willingly embarqued themſelues in the labour, ſo the reſt of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects might be vrged to help to forme and bring forth this birth, not of an infant, but of a man; nay, of a people, of a kingdom, wherein are many king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. When <hi>Alcmena</hi> was in trauell with <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> the Poets ſay <hi>Iupiter</hi> was faine to be Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife; and ſure, as we haue the countenance of our earthly <hi>Iupiter,</hi> ſo we are humbly to emplore the propitious preſence of our heauenly God, toward the perfection of this ſo great a worke. And ſo lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to medle further with what we haue nothing to do, let vs returne to our ſhips, out of whoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainements we may either reioyce at their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, or by other obſeruations preuent their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay: &amp; becauſe we propounded to our ſelues the neceſſity of our home-fiſhing out of the want of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:26892:15"/>our ſhipping, we will affirme that by this our ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficiall view we find a decay thereof, &amp; that out of two reaſons; becauſe that in places formerly frequented, our ſhipping leſſeneth, and in places new found, they doe not ſucceed: we haue giuen reaſonable probability of theſe already without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pleaſure, &amp; there is no need of repetition, and it will be more apparant in the preferring of this deſire of Fiſhing, out of the examination of the next induceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t therto, which is <hi>want of Mariners.</hi>

                  <hi>Mariners,</hi> they vſe the weapons, ſhippes, they weare the ornaments, ſhippes, out of them ſhips, are ſtrength and pleaſure: otherwiſe they are but Pictures, that haue but a ſhew, or are as carkaſſes bereft of life. It is the good Pilot that bringeth the Shippe to the Hauen: It is the wiſe Maiſter that gouerneth the men in the Ship; but without men the Maiſter cannot gouerne, nor the ſhippe goe: What is a Leader without an Army, and that of Souldiers? the ſame reaſon of Sea-men in a ſhip; the body muſt haue life, bloud and fleſh: the ſame are Sea-men to a ſhippe. <hi>Columbus</hi> found out the new world, <hi>Drake</hi> brought home the hidden trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in a ſhip; but they were both prouided well of men, and gouerned well: therefore as Shippes are manned; and as Maſters vſe their men, ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily their ſhippes ſucceede. As for this laſt matter of gouernement, it is beſides our buſines, wee will leaue that to whom it concerneth. Now then, though wee cannot vſe ſhipping without men, and therefore they muſt goe together; yet we muſt conſider the one after the other, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:26892:15"/>looked into the ſtrength of the one, we will view in them the ſtate of the other, in the which wee will not be long, for that the ſubiect is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant, and our Tale is halfe tolde already: for the conſequence is neceſſary. As ſhippes are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, ſo men are buſied.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Moſcouy,</hi> it is apparant that the ſhipping thitherward is decayed; ſo neither Mariners are well employed that way, nor any. Sea-men almoſt bred. The fleete that went ordinarily thitherward entertained three or foure Nouices in a ſhip, and ſo bred them vp Sea-men, which might make in the whole happily ſome foure ſcore men yearely, which was well for their partes. Now then there were ſome fiue hundred Mariners and Saylers employed withall: ſo then this way there is want.</p>
               <p>The like reaſon of the Straights in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, the very bottome of the Straights failing in thirtie ſhippes, maketh yearely ſeuen hundred Sea-men and Mariners at the leaſt, ſeeke ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſes which were that way employed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the vnder-growth hindred of ſome hundred and forty ſea-men yearly. And but that I am loath to renue our complaints; I would ſay it were great pitty of this ſo great an ebbe of our men in theſe ſeas, for that beſides the voyages were of encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement euen to the <hi>Frie,</hi> all in generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly went and returned in good health, a ſhip ſeldome looſing a man in a voyage; nay, I heard a proper Maiſter of a ſhippe ſay, that in eighteene yeares, wherein he frequented thoſe parts, he loſt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:26892:16"/>not two men out of his ſhip: and whatſoeuer may bee imputed to the incontinencie of our men, or the vnwholſomneſſe of the women in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſurely in thoſe parts I heare the common ſort of women to be as dangerous, and the generalitie of our men as idely diſpoſed.</p>

               <p>Our ſhipping into <hi>France,</hi> is not ſuch as it hath beene, but nourſeth many yong men, or rather ſheweth them the Sea, and may buſie ſome ſeuen or eight hundred men.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Norway</hi> and the <hi>Sound</hi> may breed and employ ſome foure hundred men, thoſe parts being moſt frequented, thoſe commodities moſt brought in by the <hi>Hollanders.</hi>

                  <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> voyage is the next, and if not the onely, yet the eſpeciall Nurſery, and Schoole of Sea-men: For, as it is the chiefeſt in employment of Sea-men, ſo it is the gentleſt, and moſt open to land-men: They neuer grudging in their ſmalleſt veſſels to entertaine ſome two freſh-men, or lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; whereas, to the contrary, in the Shippes that voyage to the South-ward, or otherwiſe, farre out of the Kingdome, there is no Owner, or Maiſter, that will ordinarily entertaine any land-man, be he neuer ſo willing, as being bound by their <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-partie</hi> to the Marchant, as they ſay, not to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry but ſufficient men, and ſuch as know their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and can take their turne at the helme, toppe, and yard. It is by great fauour that others ſlip in, and they very likely; and therefore whereas in former aduentures I allow them the bringing vp of two or three men in a voyage, it is in generall to be vnderſtood, that they were firſt trained vp, either amongſt the Coliers in this iourney: or elſe came out of Fiſhermens Boates, and yet but Nouices to thoſe Seas and Saylors,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:26892:17"/>ſo then this Trade, without all exception, admits of all ſorts that neuer ſee the Sea before: whereby are yearly bred and employed, out of the great ſtore of ſhips buſied therein, ſome two or three thouſand people. A great comfort to youth, and men that want employment, and a great ſtay to the Sea ſtate, that ſhall haue need on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of their helpe. I haue ſhewed my good will enough, being ſo priuate, to further their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; and being ſo ignorant I muſt not bee bolder.</p>

                  <hi>Iſland</hi> entertainement, asketh and nouriſheth ſome two thouſand fiue hundred men; after the number of ſhipping and barques ſet downe, and ordinarily employed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>New-found-land</hi> may breed and employ ſome fifteene hundred; but ſeeing what diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they haue, what caſualties they are ſubiect to we may iudge of their incertainty.</p>
               <p>Out of the extraordinary number of all people buſied in theſe two former employments; it is no vnneceſſary obſeruation, that in any Trade in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, our coale excepted, our ſpeciall employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nouriſhment, and encreaſe of Sea-men, is euen in this forraine fiſhing, which I hope will proue but petty, when it commeth to be balanced with our home fiſhing.</p>
               <p>The laſt Conſiſtance of Shipping propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, was that of the <hi>Eaſt Indies:</hi> which though yongeſt, was found in ſhew and ſtate to haue ouer-topped all the reſt; as a bird that maketh herſelfe gay with the feathers of all other fowles;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:26892:17"/>hauing borrowed; nay, hauing bought the beſt Shippes out of other Trades to honour their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and plumed euen <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> her ſelfe, of her ſhipping: therefore that men are entertained extraordinarily in this voyage, it is apparant out of the greatneſſe of the Shipping; the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of them increaſing, it ſhould be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent that Sea-men increaſe this way: But that wee may not by ambages tryumph in their loſſe, or our calamities, wee ſee this way that our Shippes periſh, and therefore our men they ſhrinke. Nay, though ſhippes come home, yet they leaue the men behinde: ſo in this voyage, there is a two-fold way towards our want of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners.</p>
               <p>In that Shippes, nay great Shippes, are extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily ſubiect to bee caſt away, and then there muſt bee loſſe likewiſe of men; In that though they come, they come home emptied of their men.</p>
               <p>By the loſſe of foure Shippes, wee haue loſt at the leaſt foure hundred and fifty men: and in the adventure of ſome three thouſand that haue beene imployed ſince that voyage beganne, wee haue loſt many aboue two thouſand.</p>

               <p>The firſt was vnder Sir <hi>Henry Middleton,</hi> whoſe former gouernment in that kind of voyage, had approued his wiſdome and moderation. His ſhip was that famous and infortunate veſſell of eleuen hundred Tun;

               <p>As one Swallow maketh no Summer, ſo it is not much to bee maruailed, that in all theſe voyages ſome one Ship hath not beene ſcarred, and not elſe much hurt in this iourney: She indeed but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſeeing thoſe Coaſts, and preſently on ſo great a glut of our men and ſhips, with the which it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the Sea and Land was then buſied and full: when as Captaine <hi>Newport</hi> returned with little loſſe, and in ſhort time.</p>
               <p>Now then as we haue ſaid before, that the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſhippes die not the ordinary death of Shippes: and that we haue ſhewen likewiſe before, that men doe die extraordinarily in this voyage, which is almoſt incredible: they are diſtreſſed likewiſe after

Fabulous and phantaſticall Legends haue beene made of the reſtleſſe death of many concealed extortioners, and murderers, whoſe ghoſts haue been ſaid to walke in paine and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. On the contrary, how many liue bodies, indeed the true images of the deceaſed, complain on the death, call for the due of their friends, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Husbands, Children, Kinsfolkes, and Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors? Poore <hi>Ratlife, Lime-houſe, Blacke wall, Shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, Wapping,</hi> and other Sea-townes abroad can ſenſibly tell. The Marchant he is at home, and therefore he cannot embezell the goods abroad: and it is likely, that what is directly proued due, is paid here to theirs. Then is the calamity of that iourney more fearfull, becauſe out of his owne ill Planet it maketh ſo many miſerable. How this is recompenced it is neither my purpoſe, nor my part to examine: For certaine there is want of Trade: the <hi>Hollander</hi> would grow greater, if he had all this Trade in his own hands. The Kings cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes are now aduanced: This way Shipwrights are ſet on worke, which muſt be maintained; and other Mechanical Trades liue hereby, with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of poore buſied. And ſurely he that would not haue the poore to liue, I would he might begge: And he that would not advance the Kings profire in all liber all manner; and Marchandize is a faire
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:26892:20"/>meanes, I would he might dye: and he that regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not his Countries good, it is pitty he was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer borne. I deſire not, like a ſecond <hi>Phaeton,</hi> to make a combuſtion. All that I would enforce at this time is, that in this trade our men are conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and thereby more want of Mariners. Let the <hi>Straights</hi>-men, and the <hi>Lisbone</hi>-Merchants com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of their hinderance this way, and ſay their traffique before was more beneficiall by much, and more certaine to the Cuſtom-houſe then the Indies be now. Let others report that the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this trade was layd in the ruine of a <hi>Caricke</hi> that Sir <hi>Iames Lancaſter</hi> tooke in the firſt voyage, and that the maine of this after-iollity proceeded of the forced trade driuen with the <hi>Mecha</hi> Fleete by Sir <hi>Henry Middleton,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Wherein hee was his owne Trade-caruer out of tenne hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds worth of goods.</note> whereby diuers durſt not go preſently after to the <hi>Straights,</hi> as the <hi>Angell,</hi> and other ſhippes, out of rumour of reuenge for violence offered by our <hi>Indian</hi> men to the Turkes in the red ſea. Let the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people ſay that their commodities are vnneceſſary: aske the Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, nay all men, what they haue cheaper: looke into the price of victuals how it riſeth out of their great prouiſions. Let the whole land murmure at the tranſport of treaſure, and bring in <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth his opinion,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hall Chron.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:26892:20"/>profite. Once I am ſure, that as <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour ſayd, He had rather ſaue one Citizen, then kill one thouſand enemies; ſo his royall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty had rather haue his Subiects, then Cuſtome for them: and you ſee plainly, that his Maieſties ſubiects, our country-men, fall this way, and this way is want of Mariners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Greenland</hi> ſhips, which before I had forgotten, entertaine ſome Mariners, and helpe to breed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; as of late being fifteene ſaile, employ ſome foure hundred men, and may breed of theſe ſome foureſcore, which helpe ſomwhat, and may be, by reaſonable encouragement, farre more benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, if it be more publique.</p>
               <p>And thus we haue runne ouer the materiall trades ſtate and condition in them of ſea-men. In all in generall we conceiue want, in regard of the ſmall increaſe of what is needfull to furniſh this great <hi>Machina,</hi> this goodly Engine of our Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, either by ſupporting their owne members, (the <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> trade excepted) or all ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to make vp the great body of our Lands Nauy: witneſſe that general preſſe that was made of men from all the Coaſts, to man the ſhippes that were to attend that matchleſſe pearle, that peerleſſe Princeſſe the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her grace, with her hopefull and happy mate, the illuſtrious <hi>Palatine,</hi> at their departure; and our nakedneſſe that would appeare if there were ſudden occaſion to furniſh ſome ſixe of his Maieſties ſhippes: all which maketh for the furtherance of our propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fiſhing.</p>

And with this diſeaſe is our Land affected, our people infected; whereby ſo many come to an vntimely &amp; reproachfull death in the Land, &amp; many more liue ſo diſsolutely, and ſo wickedly on the ſeas.

               <p>Then the place is not farre remoued, if in our owne Seas, if in his Maieſties Dominions, on the coaſt of <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland,</hi> is this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall fiſhing: for by the report of many exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this myſterie, and the relation of two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, painefull herein by their Treatiſes, <hi>Hitchcockes</hi> and <hi>Gentleman,</hi>

               <p>On the North-weſt ſeas of <hi>England,</hi> ouer againſt <hi>Carliel,</hi> about <hi>Wirkentowne,</hi> is good fiſhing for Herring from <hi>Bartholmewtide</hi> till fourteene daies after <hi>Michaelmas.</hi> So then it appeareth by theſe reports, that this fiſhing for Herring is eſpecially on his Maieſties dominions. And to this end aske the ancient cuſtome of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,</hi> that before they beganne their fiſhing for Herring, craued leaue of <hi>Scarbrough</hi> aforeſayd: which eaſily obtained, they then layd their Nets. And howſoeuer it pleaſeth his Maieſty to allow of his royall Predeceſſours bounty, in tolerating the neighbour Nations to fiſh in his ſtreames: yet other Princes take more ſtraight courſes. For whereas till <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> on the coaſt of <hi>Norway,</hi> called the <hi>Mall Strand,</hi> all ſtrangers do fiſh, as <hi>Hitchcockes</hi> writeth, they then paid a <hi>youhendale</hi> on euery Laſt of Herring, to the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke.</hi> And I can likewiſe remember, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of our Merchants of <hi>Hull</hi> had their goods and Shippes taken away, and themſelues impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for fiſhing about the Ward-houſe, and not paying the duty impoſed on them by the King of <hi>Denmarke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The place, our Seas likewiſe, for other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and profitable fiſhing: on the Coaſt of <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> from Eaſter to Midſummer, for Cod, for Hakes; twixt <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> from <hi>Whitſontide</hi> vntill Saint <hi>Iames-tide,</hi> for Cod,

               <p>Now beſides this fiſhing treaſure lyeth eaſily to bee found in our owne Seas, what good Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours fitting thereto lye open to vs in our owne Coaſts, as <hi>Colcheſter, Harwich, Ipſwich, Yarmouth,</hi> with a number of other, ſet downe painfully by <hi>Gentleman,</hi> together with the commodities they affoord for Timber, Workemanſhip, furniſhing, and harbouring Buſſes, Nets, and Men?</p>
               <p>As the Hauens lye open to vs, as the Seas bee our owne, and as we haue all things almoſt fitting for ſuch a buſineſſe at home, and naturally, ſo that nothing may bee wanting to vs but our ſelues; the Art is well knowne to vs likewiſe. Maiſters for Buſſes may be had from <hi>Yarmouth</hi> and <hi>Sould,</hi> and the reſt of the coaſts downe the riuer. Vſe maketh Fiſhermen, and theſe places affoord ſtore of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring men for the purpoſe. In <hi>Orford</hi> Hauen and <hi>Alborough</hi> be many good Fiſhermen, whoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities exerciſed in Buſſes, would (by <hi>Gentlemans</hi> report) put downe the <hi>Hollander.</hi> The like may be ſayd of <hi>Sould, Dunwich, Walderſwich,</hi> which breede Fiſhermen. In all theſe, and many other places, is this rich Art knowne, but not vſed. In all theſe, and all other, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſwimme like Elephants, we wading like Sheepe.

               <p>Beſides, to encourage vs the more, the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are not great, the paines are not great, the time is not long, the hazard is nothing at all. This is very apparant, and exactly ſet downe in <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> his Treatiſe, whom I ſhall but obſcure to contract; neither is he long.</p>
               <p>The next motiue to this fiſhing, was that of profite; wherein if euer it were true, that a good cauſe maketh a good Orator, here is a ſubiect to enable all meane Rhetoricians. Euery man almoſt is taken with the attention to profite. Loue doth much, but Mony doth all. Here is money, heere is profite in aboundance, and diuers waies. In aboundance, for that the whole charge of a Buſſe,
<note place="margin">That is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene ſixtie and eightie tunne.</note> with all furniture and appurtenances, betweene thirty and forty Laſt, will coſt about fiue hundred pounds: the charges for keeping her a whole ſummer at Sea, may be ſome three hundred three ſcore and fiue pounds: the whole Summer filleth her three times, with making one hundred Laſt of barrels, amounteth to one thouſand pounds; wherby, allowing one hundred pounds for weare of ſhips, and reparations of nets, there is gained fiue hundred ſixtie fiue pounds by one Buſſe in one yeare, and this is after ten pounds the Laſt, which was ſo rated in <hi>Hitchcockes</hi> time, which is ſome thirty three yeres agoe; the <hi>Hollander,</hi> now, ſelling them for fifteene, twenty pounds, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Laſt, at <hi>Danske.</hi> Hence one may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the great gaine, that euen riſeth to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate purſe, by this fiſhing, with a ſmall aduenture, Buſſes being the maine (and thoſe likely likewiſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:26892:24"/>to continue, by Gods grace, ſome twenty yeares) So then her charges returned for keeping her at ſea; the firſt yeare alſo ſhe quitteth her own ſelfe, and there is, I ſay, fiue hundred ſixty fiue pounds, as long as ſhe liueth afterwards, <hi>dc claro.</hi> I would faine know, not deſiring to be too curious in a ſtrange Common-wealth, but rather to inuite my Countrey-men into this ſociety, what Trade in the Land did euer in his ſtrength promiſe ſo much; howſoeuer, neuer any, I am ſure, perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſo much, ſo eaſily, ſo continually.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Antiochus,</hi> in his ſhew to <hi>Hanniball</hi> of his glorious Army in battel-range, his Elephants being moſt richly adorned, and all his Souldiers in very braue and coſtly harneſſe and abiliments, willing to draw ſome acknowledgement from him of his power and ſtrength, asked his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it: the warlike Souldier replied againe, That it was an Armie able to ſatisfie the moſt couetous enemy. No queſtion, though the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi> noted the people of cowardiſe; yet it would require great charges, &amp; coſt ſome bloud, to ouercome ſuch an Armie.</p>
               <p>In the beſt Trade in appearance now that is, (and in thoſe Countries certaine there are infinite riches) you ſee how remote it is, and with what coſt of purſe, and loſſe of people followed, yet without ſuch ſatisfaction. Here is wealth enough to ſatisfie the moſt thirſty thereof, without much coſt, without any ſpoyle; euen almoſt <hi>Salmacida ſpolia;</hi> if not, <hi>ſine ſudore, ſine ſanguine,</hi> and not for a time, but permanent. All other Trades are fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:26892:24"/>as it were, out of a Well, out of the Deepe, I meane from farre, heere is a meere ſpring which is in ſuperficie hard by vs, out of our owne inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible Sea, from the euer-laſting ſtore of Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, whence onely the <hi>Hollander</hi> reapeth a milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of gold yearely; beſides, the moſt gainefull fiſhing with other veſſels for <hi>Cod</hi> and <hi>Ling. Hitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cockes</hi> long agoe diſcouered the ſame, his booke is extant; and fore-named <hi>Gentleman</hi> hath very plainly ſet downe, and in very probable and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner diſcloſed the myſteries thereof. And the conceit the <hi>Hollanders</hi> haue of it, calling it their <hi>Chiefeſt Trade and Gold-mine:</hi> and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence they haue in it, as laying out their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens money giuen them by friends, in aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in Buſſes, and fathers likewiſe putting in their childrens portions into Buſſes; preſume of the increaſe that way, and ſo proportion a ſumme cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine out of that gaine, in a certaine time; as alſo that there is for Orphanes laid out, and ſo increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that way for the maintenance of them. Here then we may get treaſure in aboundance, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly; and beſides the gaining of it, we ſhall ſtay the vnnaturall tide of the departure and tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our gold; a miſchiefe, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our royall King was ſenſible of in the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it, yet it ſtill departeth with <hi>Veſtigia nulla re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trorſum,</hi> out of the lazy and diſgracious Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize of our Coaſters, that giue away our coine to the ſtranger for our owne fiſh.

               <p>But ſome will ſay, that our men are not ſo apt, nor diſpoſed thereto: which cannot be, in regard of the ſtore of Fiſhermen that our Coaſts nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth, which liue as hardly, and take as great paines in their faſhion; onely wanting the vſe of Buſſes, &amp; ſeeme to reioyce at the name of Buſſes, and may on very good reaſon; for that this Buſſe-fiſhing is more eaſy then any other kind of fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which now we vſe in Crayers and Punts, as being armed this way better againſt all weathers, which others ſuffer and periſh in, in other veſſels yearly. And as their prouiſions are better, and the dangers leſſe, ſo their paines are likewiſe leſſe.</p>
               <p>Againe, who will not be exceedingly encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged with the benefite of ſuch gaine, in ſo honeſt a manner, when once the ſweete is taſted of, when as otherwiſe our Countrimen runne ſuch laborious and deſperate courſes, eſpecially out of want.</p>
               <p>Others will ſay that our Land will not vtter them in any quantity, in regard that the feeding on her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and fiſh, doth not taſte vs, nor is ſo receiued as amongſt thoſe <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Sealand</hi> Mermaids. And ſure, if thoſe neceſſary Lawes prouided by our aduiſed State, for the keeping of fiſh daies cleane through our Land were better obſerued, it would be more wholeſome for our bodies, and make much for the aduancing of our fiſh, &amp; plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of other victuals; beſides the deereneſſe of our fiſh victuall, which more hurteth our purſe then our appetites, for that the price is within this 20. yeares almoſt trebled, which indeed maketh the

Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding there is ſuch quantity of herring, beſides other fiſh, conſumed amongſt vs, that <hi>Hitchcockes</hi> alloweth 10000 Laſts for our prouiſion of her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to be ſpent here in the Realme; ſo that it wold ſaue at home 100000 pounds of treaſure, which to our great ſhame and loſſe, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> carry away, euen for our owne prouiſion: beſides, that prouiſion is of the worſt, ſuch as they call Roop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, &amp; ſuch as they are forbidden to bring home. Now to be ſerued of our worſt, whereas we might be our owne caruers, and to giue our gold for that we may haue for nothing; iudge of the loſſe, of the indignity.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:26892:26"/>being Lord <hi>Paramount</hi> of theſe Seas where this fiſhing food groweth, and which now is taken by ſtrangers? and therefore hee would not queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe allow ſtrangers to eate vp the foode that was prouided for the children; the crummes we would not enuy them, though wee are now fed vnder their Table.</p>
               <p>Now farther it may be alleaged, that we can vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter no ſuch quantity, nor can affoord no ſuch pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worth. For the firſt, that muſt ariſe out of our diligence. No queſtion we once attaining the Art of the Flemiſh vſage of theſe Herring, they will be in as great eſtimation as the Hollanders, in <hi>Normandy, Nants, Burdeaux, Rochell,</hi> and other ſuch Countries; for which, returne is made of Wine and Woad, for which is alwaies paid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy gold, with a number of other commodities: They will be in as great eſtimation in the Eaſt Countries, <hi>Reuel, Rie, Ruſsie, Danſke, Poland, Denmarke,</hi> the returnes whereof are ſet downe in <hi>Gentleman.</hi> And the quantity of Herring that theſe fore-named Countries conſume is infinite. Therefore though the Hollanders ſpend more Fiſh and Herring by much, in their Countries then we do, yet it is their forraigne Trade with all other Nations that is their <hi>Baſis,</hi> elſe they could neuer employ ſo many Shippes, nor gaine ſuch wealth, or get ſuch ſtrength thereby. And in all theſe places wee can and doe Trade, and all their returnes wee neede and vſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may vtter them in as great a quantity as they doe.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:26892:26"/>
               <p>Then for the affoording of Herring and Fiſh at as good a rate as they can, let any conſider of the likelyhood in our behalfe. Firſt it ſtandeth with reaſon, if we haue the like veſſels, we can go with as few men: and our fiſhermen on the Coaſt, by diuers reports, can liue as hardly as they. And let any iudge of the hardneſſe, when the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall time of fiſhing for Herring is in September and October, and a ſixe weekes time, and they are almoſt in ſight of our owne Coaſts; and beſides good prouiſion of butter and cheeſe and Beere, they haue the plenty of the ſea-fiſh: then this way wee may affoord as good penyworths as they. But I goe further, and ſay that we haue great van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of them.</p>
               <p>The Seas be our owne, therefore we iourney not ſo farre as the Hollander doth, whereby like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe our trauaile and charge muſt be lighter: our ports, harbours and roades be at hand; nay, which is more, all <hi>vtenſiles</hi> and appurtenances belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſhipping, as is before ſhewed (Pitch and Tarre excepted) are found in our owne Land; whereas they with great coſt, paines, and hazard, fetch them from ſixe ſeuerall places. So then we ſhall be able to affoord better cheape then the Hollanders;
<note place="margin">You Engliſh we will make you glad to weare our old ſhooes.</note> and ſo we may ſell when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, and ſo the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhall and may wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them, and weare out thoſe flouts wherewith our poore Fiſher-men are ſcorned. For if they bee put by the vttering of their Herrings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, they will bee driuen to leaue their great Ships, and fiſh in ſmaller veſſels neere the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:26892:27"/>ſhore to ſerue their owne turnes, as heretofore they haue cauſed vs to doe; when as likewiſe on euery tempeſt they openly triumph ouer vs, for not taking the bleſſings of God powred into our lappes.</p>
               <p>Theſe hinderances obiected taken away, wee may now reſort againe to the ſweete fountaine of profite: which beſides that it watereth our priuate eſtates with the continuall ſpring of great gaine, keepeth in our treaſure, which exceedingly now waſteth, bringeth in all commodities that either the Eaſt and North Countries, <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> affoords euen for this barter; it runneth into the ſea of the Kings cuſtome: the venting onely of ten thouſand Laſt of Herring beyond ſea, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to fiue thouſand pounds after the rate of the ordinary poundage, beſides the cuſtome of Cod and Ling, very neere as valuable as the benefit of Herring, the particular view whereof is ſet downe by him whom I haue ſo often named, &amp; in whoſe booke you may ſee the greatneſſe of the cuſtome amounting to aboue 50000 pound ſtarling, that accrueth to thoſe Countries out of this fiſhing Trade. And yet all this to them is nothing: their keeping in their treaſure, their carrying away our treaſure, their aboundance with all other commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, their greatneſſe of their cuſtome this way, is nothing in regard of their profit, honor, ſafety, that their increaſe of ſhipping, increaſe of Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners this way begetteth to themſelues, amongſt all nations, to their ſtate.</p>
               <p>The life of the ſea is in ſhipping, nay one may
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:26892:27"/>ſay to ſhips, <hi>Mare non eſt mare, vos eſtis mare.</hi> The beauty of the Sea is in Shipping: and ſure the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets affirming <hi>Venus</hi> to be the daughter of the ſea, might meane a Ship by her.

               <p>There hath bene numbred in ſight two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſaile of Buſſes, and other good veſſels, gone out to ſea at once of the <hi>Hollanders:</hi> and there hath beene found (by computation) ſome thirty ſeuen thouſand Fiſhermen in diuers ſorts of veſſels at one time employed herein. Hence proceede their great vndertakings, and prodigious aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing to all places: hereby they out-goe vs, and ouer-beare all Trades where euer they come. Wee thinke the Weſt-Indie gold to be the cauſe of the pride and preſumption of <hi>Spaniards:</hi> we may aſſure our ſelues, that our North-Indies counteruaile that treaſure, and are the onely confidence of the <hi>Hollander;</hi> euen by breeding ſea-men, and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of ſhipping in that aboundance, as that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they both ſwarme euety where, and <hi>France, Spaine,</hi> and the Eaſt Countries are full of their ſhipping. Hence they fetch our coales, and carry them abroad; from <hi>Norway</hi> and <hi>Danske</hi> they bring vs all commodities, and carry forth ours, at a farre better rate then we can our ſelues: they haue fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Moſcouy,</hi> whence we are emptied, with thither
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:26892:28"/>ſhipping; and the <hi>Straights</hi> abound with them, once our poſſeſſion. They go into, nay they arme in the Weſt Indies where we may not be ſeene; and in the Eaſt Indies they haue had long ſetled Factories before vs, and haue foure men to one of ours there, and go beyond vs as farre, beſides the number in ſtore of goodly ſhipping; whereby, as they hinder our trade, ſo they forbeare not (which I cannot but write with ſtomacke) the honour of our King and kingdome, as preſuming ſomtimes to call themſelues <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and pretend Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and preſents from his Maieſty. Which they did to the King of <hi>Siam:</hi> in other places calling the Crowne and State of <hi>England</hi> into compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; which made the King of <hi>Achem</hi> aske captaine <hi>Beſt,</hi> whether the King of <hi>England,</hi> or the King of <hi>Holland,</hi> were the greater Monarke.</p>
               <p>Beſides, what an infinite number of ſhippes and men of warre haue they alwayes in a readineſſe at home? And as the In-keeper of <hi>Chalcis</hi> ſayd to his gueſt, admiring <hi>tantam ferculorum varietatem,</hi> It was with Art all cookt out of pork; this their ſtore, this their aboundance, is raiſed all out of fiſhing. Who then would not be moued? who would not be ſtirred vp therewith? Who would not goe a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing? You ſee what want we haue of ſhipping, what want we haue of Mariners, what diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we haue in trades, what wants our men are in. When <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Sirian</hi> complained to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizeus</hi> of his leproſie, he was bid waſh himſelfe in <hi>Iordan</hi> ſeuen times. He looked for other miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous courſes to be taken by the Prophet, and could
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:26892:28"/>hardly be perſwaded thereto, becauſe <hi>Abna</hi> and <hi>Pharphar</hi> (flouds of <hi>Damaſcus</hi>) were better. <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was a Heathen, and had neuer any experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Gods <hi>Iordan:</hi> yet hee was in the end per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded. To ſupply our wants, to ſatisfie our hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to heale our diſeaſes, there is not a riuer, but a Sea, ſhewen vs, and that not in another king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but in our owne; wee are but bidden goe and take fiſh out of it. Wee are Chriſtians, and it is God that hath prouided this remedy: and we ſee by experience no water like ours, and wee ſee our neighbours from every place reſorting thereto, and healing themſelues thereby. You ſee how it concerneth vs; let vs in the end like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be perſwaded. What the number is of our Sea-men, bred and employed by all ſorts of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trades, (our petty fiſhings excepted) may eaſily be gheſt at; and whatſoeuer it may amount to. If out of our whole Land there bee but foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Buſſes built, and ſet forth, of ſeuenty tunne the peece, there are in two yeares nine thouſand Mariners more then was in the Land before: let men of experience and ſtate iudge of the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the way of compariſon, euery one can perceiue the increaſe ſimply. Beſides, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of ſome of our beſt Mariners, theſe thus bred, proue not onely equall, but better able then any bred otherwiſe, for Sea-affaires, and publique ſeruice.</p>
               <p>On this publik profit of fiſhing thus ſpred abroad the maintenance of Hauens and Hauen townes in <hi>England</hi> beſides, haue no ſmall dependancie, and are ſo materiall to the land, ſo plainly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:26892:29"/>of all his Maieſties ſubiects; and ſo wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſhed to by <hi>Hitchcockes</hi> and <hi>Gentleman,</hi> that it is enough for me but to poynt at them: we all know the vſe of them: they ſhew the decay; and this Art, the reparation and maintenance of them.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this fiſhing is implied much in the profite, but more eminent by the conſideration againe of the infinite number otherwiſe of idle people, &amp; out of imployment. Onely by this Art, it is reported not one goeth a begging in all the <hi>Low-countries;</hi> and what a number of people haue we, that, now deſtitute of meanes, may this way haue a calling? It is a grieuous ſin, Idleneſſe, and bringeth forth, as we ſee, horrible effects: to get a liuing by the ſweat of our brows, is the ordinance of God, &amp; this way there is a recompence. There were found in <hi>Yarmouth</hi> the laſt yeare, three or foure hundred, and thoſe of honeſt diſpoſition, that wanted meanes: &amp; how many hundred more are there in other places, that wold gladly be thus vſed? <hi>Hichcockes</hi> alloweth to euery one in this imployment, twenty pounds yearely, beſides his diet, for his reward, a good ſauour to honeſt men that now haue no meanes; and this onely out of two voyages for Herring. A number of Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Shipwrights ſhall be ſet a work, Coopers buſied numbers of people making lines, ropes, cables,, dreſſers of hempe, ſpinners of thrid, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Nets, bred; many ſalt-houſes ſet vp, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what ſtore of poore people, all along on the ſea-coaſts, which are now very poore and idle in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> to be vſed in ſplîtting of fiſh, waſhing of fiſh, packing, ſalting, carrying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrying
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:26892:29"/>of fiſh. And on theſe foreſaid occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons depend an infinite number of ſeruants, boyes &amp; daily labourers, for the vſe of things needfull. <hi>Nilus,</hi> whoſe fertility is enuied, affoordeth not ſo many ſorts of fiſh, of monſters, as this fiſhing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaineth ſorts of people: which humbly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the high diſpoſer of all hearts, &amp; to the due conſideration therby of his Miniſters here on earth, I will leaue further to enlarge; and ſhut vp this abrupt diſcourſe with the alluſion of that of <hi>Baſil</hi> to this ſea-buſineſſe, <hi>Putei dum hauriuntur ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioſiores.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for a Corollary to all theſe imperfect lines: whereas in the ſuperficiall ſuruey of want of ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, we find moſt of our ſea-trades, either decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or at a ſtay, let me out of themſelues, without offence, propound the conſideration of one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy therto; euen by a <hi>freedom of Traffique</hi> for all his Maieſties ſubiects to al places. Hereby his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties cuſtomes will increaſe, the nauy &amp; ſea-men will receiue nouriſhment out of more imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the whole incorporation of marchants reap comfort, in that they may communicate with all aduentures, and the vniverſal body of the ſubiects of the land content, in that they may become mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants; being very ready in this aduentrous world to make new diſcoueries: whereas now otherwiſe merchandize, ſorting &amp; ſetled in companies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fineth merchants into thoſe limits that priuate or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders tie them in, ſo that they may not helpe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues through any diſcouragements in one trade, but by ſute and ſubmiſſion of themſelues to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; though, I ſay, their trades faile them, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:26892:30"/>haue too much: nor may any elſe of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome come amongſt them, though neuer ſo able and well diſpoſed, vnleſſe they come in on ſuch conditions as the victor pleaſeth to propound. A thing in ordinary ſence ſomewhat harſh to fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſubiects, and equall Citizens in this great Monarchie, to be ſo ſeruiceably tyed and ſubiect one vnto the other; and the rather for that thoſe priuiledges, by the indulgencie of the Prince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing granted as a reward to ſome for their indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtries, and exemplary to others incouragements, are ſtrictly vſed to the eternall benefite of a few, and the wrong of all the reſidue.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> company manifeſteth this plainly, which if it had continued (and it beganne but the other day) had vndone all the Weſterne men.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Moſcouie</hi> company declareth the ſame, as being granted on condition of ſeruing his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of all materials (as Flaxe, Oyle, Waxe, Tallow, Cordage) belonging to ſhipping: whereas now it is ſupplyed by ſtrangers, euen ten for one ſhip, and thoſe double our burdens; and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they doe not performe, and haue let fall their Trade, yet none may enter but on their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Greenland</hi> company, out of the pretence of their firſt Whale-hunting, keepe all Fiſhermen, notwithſtanding they knew and vſed thoſe ſeas, from further reſort thither: and ſome Marchants of <hi>Hull</hi> were taken by them in that iourney, and brought backe; notwithſtanding, as I am infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, thoſe countrey-men found it firſt.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:26892:30"/>
               <p>The <hi>Virginia</hi> company pretend almoſt all that Maine twixt it and <hi>New-found-land</hi> to bee their Fee-ſimple, whereby many honeſt and able mindes, diſpoſed to aduenture, are hindred, and ſtopped from repairing to thoſe places, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knew or would diſcouer vnfound euen for fiſhing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Eaſt India</hi> men, not able to furniſh thoſe places they reſort to, keepe out other from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming amongſt them, and to looke into thoſe parts they know not, and would giue out of their largeneſſe and riches, entertainment to all the Marchants in the Land. Beſides, how tedious and coſtly they, and all other Companies, make it to their owne Aſſociates, when as out of orders, and cauſe of vpholding their Trade, men can neither diſpoſe of their owne as they would, nor haue the benefite vnder a long time. Beſides, how priuate doe they, and other Companies, make it, when as out of orders and maintaining their Trade, how plentifully ſoeuer the commodities are brought in, and at what advantage ſoeuer they buy them, they will be ſure to keepe vp the price, either by ſending forth moſt part of the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities abroade, or elſe by buying all others into their hands? that other is hard for the owner ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, but he doth it in his owne wrong; but to the buyer this is alwaies iniuſt, for that he ſuffereth againſt his will, the common-wealth being made private, ſuffereth by all; this, that, the firſt, and all the more diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentful, in that beſides that all other Nations reſort freely to all thoſe places whence they keepe out their owne Country-men, the like
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:26892:31"/>faſhion of Companies and Societies is not vſed in all Chriſtendome elſe; it being lawfull and vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to all other amongſt themſelues, promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to frequent and communicate with places, and Trades, one by the other. Nay, this ſeparation of Trading, and excepting of Subiects from pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, betweene diuers Princes that had but peace one with the other, was ſo admired and diſallowed of,
<note place="margin">

How much more we, murmuring at this ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, may affirme that we are all <hi>Britaines,</hi> all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to one royall King, all combined together in one naturall league, and therefore not to be bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from trading equally to all places? which his gracious Maieſty, together with the whole aſſent of the high Court of Parliament, openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth,

                     <hi>Ann.</hi> 3.1 <hi>Iacob.</hi> 6.</note> when as there was enacted free liberty for all his Maieſties Subiects, to Trade into the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of <hi>Spaine, Portugall</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> with moſt ſufficient reaſons therfore; for the increaſe of ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, mariners, thouſands of Handicrafts men, of prices of their owne commodities, and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of them, together with the plenty of forraine commodities, &amp; a cheapneſſe of them, &amp; the bettering of his Maieſties cuſtomes. No one man euer inuented all Sciences, nor any Merchant found all places: yet they make a compenſation
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:26892:31"/>one to another. Society firſt beganne, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and ciuility, by communication. But if the world in his infancy had beene reſolued to haue held priuate what they had in poſſeſſion, and to haue concealed what they knew, there had not onely been no ciuility, but no ſociety. Yet as the firſt maintainers of Society had their honour; the firſt inuentors of Sciences and Arts their rewards; and in all well-diſpoſed States, the Induſtries of thoſe that do benefit them, haue their encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: ſo is not this my propoſition of free Trade otherwiſe entertained, then that there ſhould be a due reſpect had of all worthy aduenturers, an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecial conſideration of the charges and hazard of the firſt diſcoueries: which the ſolertious <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> examples vs, by forbidding their owne Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to trade to thoſe places which ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar purſe hath, or ſhall finde out, before that the firſt Founders haue receiued reaſonable benefite of their paines and charges; allowing them ſome ſixe returnes to their owne priuate aduentures, before any elſe ſet thitherward. If thoſe aduentures or returnes were increaſed here for the Finders content, and profit: there is no man would grudge it. But to keepe others out for euer, vnleſſe they pay, and ſubmit themſelues according to their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and to their gouernment; or vnder the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of one place found to include more then was euer meant; ſeemes very iniurious. Againe, my Propoſition is not any way ſo tumultuous, as that thereby I would excuſe all order and forme of Gouernment, in Trades, or otherwiſe to intend a promiſcuous kind of calling, or rather confuſion
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:26892:32"/>of all ſorts. Who knoweth not that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth conſiſteth, <hi>Non ex medico, &amp; medico; ſed ex medico, &amp; Agricola?</hi> as alſo that there muſt be an Oeconomicall and diſcreete partition and proportion among the members; Diuers trades, to maintaine the generall body Commerce? I haue onely poynted at ſome aberrations, but as the Nouice, trauelling through ſtrange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, <hi>Topmando,</hi> or <hi>tanquam canis ad Nilum.</hi> The proſecuting of this Argument would draw on a larger diſcourſe then all the whole former, and would then exceed a Corollary, and detaine the Reader too long. Neither like I the iſſue of med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, when men tire themſelues with controuling of publicke matters, yet many times cannot ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage their owne affaires. I make no intruſion into Merchants Myſteries, neither deſire to pry into the States ſecrecie. It was a fooliſh complaint of the Poet, <hi>Cur aliquid vidi?</hi> it is much more for me to ſay, <hi>Cur aliquid ſcripſi?</hi> I am ſo far from giuing any cauſe of publique offence, that I would not iuſtly prouoke any priuate perſon. I was borne in the Cittie, and liue amongſt Sea-men. And as ſome Almanacke-makers, when they pretend ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſſe in their Calculations, though they doe but roue, vſe to appropriate their obſeruations to the place they liue in: ſo I, writing with the ſame knowledge, would ſay I deſire good to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian of theſe two places; notwithſtanding, as they ſay alſo, Theſe may ſerue alike to all the Land.</p>
